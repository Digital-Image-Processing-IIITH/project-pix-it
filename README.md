Team PIX-IT has worked on the Fast Bilateral-Space Stereo for Synthetic Defocus paper by researchers at Google.

# To run the code!
  - Please click on the 'src' folder
  - The final fully functioning python notebook with present, named 'BilateralSolver.ipynb'

### Tech

PIX-IT used a number of libraries:

%pylab inline
import pylab
* OpenCV - a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision
* Numpy - for dealing with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
* MatPlot - a plotting library 
* SciPy -  for scientific computing
* PyLab - as an interface to Matplotlib
