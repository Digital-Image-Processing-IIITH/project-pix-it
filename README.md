# PIX-IT

Team PIX-IT has worked on the Fast Bilateral-Space Stereo for Synthetic Defocus paper by researchers at Google.


##  Requirements
> This project expects the followin libraries to be present on the users system along with Python3

> These libraries can be installed via `pip`

- `Jupyter`: tools for working with code, text in one place
- `OpenCV`: a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision
- `Numpy`: for dealing with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
- `MatplotLib`: a plotting library 
- `SciPy`: for scientific computing
- `PyLab`: an interface to Matplotlib (Generally gets installed with MatPlotLib by default)

## To run the code!
  - Please open the 'src' folder
  - The 'BilateralSolver.ipynb' is our fully functional notebook. 
    - It includes all the modules, classes
    - It runs all the tests
  - Simply run all cells of 'BilateralSolver.ipynb' in order.
